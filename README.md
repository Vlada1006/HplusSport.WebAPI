# API Project â€“ Products & Categories

This is a simple API project I built while following a course on building RESTful APIs. The main focus was on creating a Product model with various endpoints, which helped me understand the fundamentals of building and structuring APIs.

To further practice and challenge myself, I went beyond the course material by implementing similar endpoints for a Category model. I also added a few extra features to make the API feel more practical and aligned with modern development standards.

The project includes:
- Full CRUD operations for both Products and Categories
- Clean and organized routing
- Additional enhancements for better usability and structure

# ðŸ”€ Advanced Features â€“ newMaster Branch
If you're interested in more advanced functionality, check out the newMaster branch. It contains the second part of the course, which covers: 
- API versioning
- Security implementations (e.g., authentication, authorization)
- Enhanced data retrieval features (pagination, filtering, sorting, searching etc).

Feel free to check out how it works!
